He took us from fes to Marrakech vai Merzouga desert through the Atlas Mountains. He is very competent and stopped at the best attractions / spots to take photos on the round trip, he is also an incredible photographer! On the first day When we arrived in the Merzouga desert, we rode a camel into the Berber camp where we had a delicious dinner and our own tent to sleep for the night. The hosts at the Berber camp were great and the food was delicious. Throughout the trip, Hassan made sure we were safe, comfortable, and had a good time. It was a trip of a lifetime and it was truly a fantastic experience. :by-><p style=" color:#6d6d6d">Diana kra on October 2018</p>

We booked a 5 days desert tour from Fez to Marrakech with Sahara Merzouga tours, and We really enjoyed our experience. While driving to the Sahara through the Atlas Mountains, we really appreciated the magnificent landscapes and the Berber music played by staff at the desert camp. In the desert, we spent an unforgettable moment. Dancing and singing with Berber instruments were incredible. The accommodations where we stayed in Merzouga and Dades and Ouarzazate were very nice and we moved their hospitality. Thanks to our guide Hassan, we learned a lot about Morocco, especially about Berbers. Hassan was the best guide we have ever had. I strongly recommend this company to everyone who is willing to visit Morocco.<p style=" color:#6d6d6d">Luis T
