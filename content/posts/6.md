As busy executives in Silicon Valley, this husband and wife team wanted to explore two new international destinations each year - but didn't have time to fully plan their vacations. Planning a complex international itinerary using online sites would take them forever. Using a traditional travel agency didn't help either, because the agents were usually generalists without expert knowledge of Brian and Yuchun's chosen destinations.
