The main layout is simple enough, with an old Fez Medina and New Town built by French protectorate in the 20th century! But here the old medina is actually two physically separate regions. Fes el Bali, the oldest part in the main stretch of the Sebou valley. And Fes el Jdid, the “new Fez city” established on the lip of the valley in the 13th century. The latter, dominated by a large precinct of Royal palaces and immense gardens, is quite easy to negotiate; Fes el Bali “old Fes”, nonetheless, where you’ll want to spend most of your time, is an unbelievable maze, narrow street, and souks “old market”, where you can find amazing things to buy in Morocco. And it takes two or three days before you even start to feel confident in where you’re going

</h2>In the far right corner of the square, a small gate marks the way into the crowded streets of the Mellah in Fez medina, the old Jewish quarter. Take a stroll down the grande Rue du Mellah, lined with shops selling household goods and food, and crammed with people, donkeys, trucks, and mopeds. At the far end, cross the main street then pass through the massive Bab Semmarin into the bustle of the Grand Rue de Fes el Jedid! Past piles of dates, figs, and prickly pears, boxes of juicy watermelons, and kebabs spluttering over makeshift grills.

The monumental blue gate leading into the old Medina is the Bab Bou Jeloud, a grand horseshoe arch flanked by two keyhole doorways. This Blue gate takes you to two main arteries of Fez medina ‘Fes el Bali’ 1st one is Talaa Seghira and 2nd one is Talaa Kebira, through an arch marked ‘Kissariat Serajine’. Follow the Talaa Kebira, and a few minutes’ walk will bring you to the Bou Inania Medersa, standing on your right-hand side.

As you leave the crowded street of Fes el Bali and enter the quiet courtyard you will find yourself bewitched by the serenity of the place. Polychrome tiles and a band of Kufic script adorn the lower walls! While above, the dark patina of aged stucco blends in harmoniously with the weathered cedar wood screens. The Muquarnas (stalactite work) above the windows is particularly fine.

After a short escape in Souk el Attarin “spice market” in Fez medina where you can pick some souvenirs for your friends and family from Fez Morocco! Like cosmetic and herbal goods, potions, Moroccan crafts …etc. And just in front of you, you will see a minaret covered in white plaster and green faience towering above an ornate gateway; this is the Zaouia of Moulay Idriss II, the founder of Fes and son of the first Moroccan Arab sovereign. But entry is forbidden to non-Muslims, and you should also refrain from taking photographs. The Zaouia (monastery) dates back to the 9th century but was rebuilt in the 13th and 18th centuries.
