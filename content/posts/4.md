Chefchaouen is undoubtedly one of Morocco's most picturesque towns and one of the world's most colorful cities. The locals simply call it Chaouen but to foreigners, it's known as "the Blue City." The streets and most of the buildings in the old part of town are painted sky blue, giving the entire city a postcard-like quality that is stunning to see in person. It's located in the Rif Mountains and is relaxed compared to other Moroccan cities, so it's a nice way to take a break from the commotion of Marrakesh or Casablanca. The blue buildings are what attract travelers to the city, but it's the laidback lifestyle and mountain backdrops that make them fall in love with it.

The best part of visiting Chefchaouen is getting lost in the labyrinth of blue-tinted streets. The color of the houses against the mountain backdrop makes the entire city feel dream-like, and whether you're a photographer or not you'll want to bring a camera along. Get lost in the medina, which is the name for the old part of town, where you can shop for souvenirs, get scrubbed down in a hammam, or get a hand-drawn henna tattoo. The Plaza Uta el-Hammam is the heart of the medina and is the spot to take a break, drink some mint tea, and watch the world go by.

 <h2 style="font-size: 15px;font-family:Rubik-Bold;;margin-bottom: 10px;margin-top: 10px">(1)Shopping in the Medina</h2>Chefchaouen is a dream to shop in especially if you're on a budget. There are loads of little stylish handbags, lampshades, and loose cotton clothes to enjoy. There are always stalls to browse, but the souk—or market—on Mondays and Thursdays in the medina is especially worth visiting. If you're looking for something more specific, you'd be better off shopping in Fez or Marrakesh where there are more options.
 <h2 style="font-size: 15px;font-family:Rubik-Bold;;margin-bottom: 10px;margin-top: 10px">(2)Kasbah Museum</h2> Kasbah means citadel or fortress, and this museum explores the city's history when it was once used as a base to protect the region. For travelers who like to learn more about the cities they visit, this should be a stop on your Chefchaouen itinerary.
 <h2 style="font-size: 15px;font-family:Rubik-Bold;;margin-bottom: 10px;margin-top: 10px">(3)Spanish Mosque<h2> The Spanish Mosque isn't just an important place of worship in the city, but it also offers some of the best panoramic views of the Blue City. It's about a 45-minute hike to reach it from Chefchaouen's eastern gate, but the views are worth the endeavor (especially if you get there for sunrise or sunset).
 <h2 style="font-size: 15px;font-family:Rubik-Bold;;margin-bottom: 10px;margin-top: 10px">(4)Hiking<h2> The Rif Mountains that surround Chefchaouen are ideal for setting out on a day hike when the weather is nice. You can book a guided hike or just set out on your own right from the city. However, most of Morocco's marijuana farms are in the Rif Mountains, so don't stray too far from the path.

 <h2 style="color:#665df5;font-family:Rubik-Bold, arial, sans-serif;font-size: 22px;margin-bottom: 10px;margin-top: 10px;">Culture and Customs</h2>
In Chefchaouen and most Arab cultures, the left hand is considered unclean. When you're eating or pointing to something, always use your right hand to do so.

In Islam, Friday is the holy day of the week and many shops or restaurants may be closed down, so plan accordingly.

Even though Morocco is generally a safe country to visit, women walking alone are likely to receive unwanted attention from men.

Amateur photographers often snap photos of locals without asking permission and the residents have understandably become averse to having their pictures taken. If you want a picture of someone, always ask first and don't feel snubbed if they decline.
