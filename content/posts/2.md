It is one of those coastal cities where the unique atmosphere and water activities seamlessly blend. Walk quietly in the shade of its ramparts, the very ones that draw the contours of Astapor, the red city of the "Game of Thrones" series. Climb these walls and take the parapet walk, from where you can see the Purpuraires Islands, falcons, gulls and seagulls hovering above this nature reserve. On the other side, surfers, windsurfers and kitesurfers are taming the waves, taking advantage from the wind.

A walk can lead you to the fishing port where the sailors are active. Get to the fish market where to taste the fish and seafood caught during the night. In the centre of the city, the medina invites you on a discovery wander into its winding alley. Ranked as the most beautiful cities in Morocco by Unesco, the city hums to the beat of music every summer : the Gnaoua festival celebrates Afro-Maghrebin rhythms making people’s stays memorable ones.

For several years now, Morocco has adopted a responsible tourism ; the eco-resort Mogador, which is an unmissable place to have peaceful moments, as well as the beaches of the surroundings labeled Blue Flag, are living proofs to this ambition.

Spend some time there, find complete mindfullness and serenety, in this enchanting destination that makes all your dreams come true !

</h2>Everything I had heard about Essaouira being relaxed and chilled is certainly true.
Firstly, there’s not a huge amount to do in Essaouira, I’m not saying that to put you off though as there are still things to do but because it’s not a city of iconic spots and it isn’t that big, there’s no need to feel like you should be somewhere and you by no means will have a jam-packed itinerary meaning it makes for a perfect weekend away from busy work and life.

Secondly, the people who praise Essaouira for its chilled-ness have usually come from the mighty intense Marrakesh. They say that compared to Marrakesh the people are lovely, its easy to get around and no one bothers you!

I agree with this however not 100%, the market sellers definitely do try to lure you in and don’t let you look in total peace, there are people begging and being a solo female did get me a few catcalls however it is by no means intimidating or ‘too much’, it’s just part of the culture and the tourist trade (not that catcalling should be accepted as either of these things!).

<h2 style="font-size: 15px;font-family:Rubik-Bold;;margin-top: 10px">(2)Good Shopping & Easy to Navigate Medina
</h2>If you want to go shopping in Morocco Essaouira is the place for you!

The medina which is essentially the area within the old walls of the city that is the main place tourists visit is full of shops and stalls. There are enough streets to keep you wandering for a few hours but it is by no means confusing or hard to navigate. There are rugs for sale, clothes, furniture, bags, shoes, plus everything else!

Best of all the sellers are all very nice. They will jump on you as soon as you linger for a few seconds or look with your hands rather than your eyes but they are not extremely pushy.

From what I had heard and read this is what Essaouira is known for, especially compared to Marrakesh so I really hope the city keeps this charm.

I had read that there is no bartering in Essaouira and everything has a set written price however this isn’t true. I only bought a few bits and looked at a few more bits and the prices being quoted did decrease as I bartered or walked away so keep this in mind, however, again, its done in a friendly way and its also all part of the culture so enjoy it!

Generally, the rule is, if there is a written price, that’s the price. If there is no price bartering can be done.
